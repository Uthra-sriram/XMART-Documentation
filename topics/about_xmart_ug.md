This User Guide is for Writers who will use the {{page.productnameshort}} system to:

- write documentation using DITA/XML
- generate a variety of content types
- publish the documentation to any documentation site

Content types supported by {{page.productnameshort}} are continuing to expand as use of the system widens its audience. Along with this documentation, {{page.productnameshort}} Wiki pages have been created with useful information on topics
such as installing and upgrading, frequently asked questions, re-use, the info model, and general use of the {{page.productnameshort}} system. Where appropriate, we have provided links to these pages in lieu of detailed instructions

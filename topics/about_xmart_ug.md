# {{page.title}}

This User Guide is for Writers who will use the XMART system to:

- write documentation using DITA/XML
- generate a variety of content types
- publish the documentation to any documentation site

Content types supported by XMART are continuing to expand as use of the system widens its audience. Along with this documentation, XMART Wiki pages have been created with useful information on topics
such as installing and upgrading, frequently asked questions, re-use, the info model, and general use of the XMART system. Where appropriate, we have provided links to these pages in lieu of detailed instructions
within this document.
